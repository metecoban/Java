### **Access Modifiers**

> We don't want to allow in everywhere about accessing. 
> So, we are using access modifiersfor protect our data.

>Most used;

> Public: Public allows to aproach in everywhere.

> Protected: Protected allows for accesing but it doesnâ€™t allow to access if the event is in different package (without inheritance).

> Private: Private doesn't allow to access without if it is not in same scope.

### **this. Keyword**

> Returns the reference of whatever object is being processed. 
> This word helps us when there are two identical words on the line

### **What is The Encapsulation ?**

> We mention that why we are using to access modifiers. So, we need to encapsulation for acces our variables of class. 
> So, we cant acces from test main class to our variables where is in different class.
> So, we need to 2 method for accessing which names are get and set methods.
> We set in set method using parameter method and this struct.
> We get in get method using return.


### **Constructors**

> When we create an object the constructor operate in own class. 
> It can be normal and with parameters.
